uBlock Origin (uBO)
</h1>

Related link: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/discussions/13259

uBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient wide-spectrum content blocker for Chromium and Firefox. It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, etc., by default using EasyList, EasyPrivacy, Peter Lowe's Blocklist, Online Malicious URL Blocklist, and uBO filter lists. There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported. uBO uses the EasyList filter syntax and extends the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.

<a name="AdGuard"></a> AdGuard for Safari
</h1>

Ad blocking extensions for Safari are having hard time since Apple [started to force everyone](https://adguard.com/en/blog/safari-adblock-extensions/) to use the new SDK. AdGuard extension is supposed to bring back the high quality ad blocking back to Safari.

Unlike other major ad blockers, AdGuard provides some extra features you are used to have with the traditional (now deprecated) extensions:

* Managing protection from Safari
* Choose among popular filter subscription
* Custom filters
* Creating your own filtering rules
* Manual blocking tool
* Allowlisting websites

AdGuard for Safari is based on the Safari native content blocking API, which makes it lightning fast, but somewhat limited in capabilities. For instance, Safari limits the number of rules a content blocker can have.

With all above said, there is a solution that is even more effective than AG Safari extension. I mean, of course, [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/adguard-mac/overview.html). It can:

* filter your traffic in all browsers and apps on your Mac
* have an unlimited number of filter rules
* provide a better filtering quality (due to the lack of browser API restrictions)

You can [try it out for free](https://adguard.com/en/download.html?os=mac&show=1).

In other words, Rethink DNS + Firewall has three primary modes, VPN, DNS, and Firewall. The VPN (proxifier) mode supports multiple WireGuard upstreams in a split-tunnel configuration. The DNS mode routes all DNS traffic generated by apps to _any_ user chosen DNS-over-HTTPS or DNSCrypt resolver. The Firewall mode lets the user deny internet-access to entire applications based on events like screen-on / screen-off, app-foreground / app-background, unmetered-connection / metered-connection; or based on play-store defined categories like Social, Games, Utility, Productivity; or additionally, based on user-defined denylists.

The automation functions of this repository are all implemented based on `GitHub Actions`

Test the speed of each free node pool on the network and the nodes shared by bloggers to screen out relatively stable and high-speed nodes, and then import them into the warehouse for sharing records.

The speed measurement function is implemented in the `GitHub Actions` environment using [LiteSpeedTest](https://github.com/xxf098/LiteSpeedTest), so there are many nodes in the United States, which cannot well represent the node availability in the domestic network environment.

## Features
- Lots of sources üòØ
- Remove all duplicate nodes ü§§
- Providing nodes in major formats (YAML, clash, v2ray, base64) ü¶ã
- No additional conversion to prevent breaking the nodes üåø
- Filtering best nodes by testing them and sorting them based on their average speed üçÄ
